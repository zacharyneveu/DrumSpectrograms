Hi everyone. This is 243MB of samples I extracted over the last couple months from a small batch of old sci-fi and horror movies listed on archive.org as Public Domain license. It includes:

24 drum hats
26 drum kicks
36 drum snares
55 drum other assorted hits
66 foley sound effects
167 melodic snippets, mostly orchestral soundtrack phrases
254 spoken phrases

Since the drums were extracted from low quality digital files of old movies they don’t have a modern dubstep-ready intensity, but I still find them useful for layering and for some musical styles like techno, hip-hop, and electronica. The foley, melodic and spoken phrases have a lot of character and charm.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:
Archive.org said the movies that these were extracted from were Public Domain license. I don’t know how safe they are to use in music production so please beware and use at your own risk.

ENJOY:
I hope you get some fun out of using these. I’d love to hear about any uses you are proud of since I am obsessed with hearing new music, but no credit to me is required, so use all you want and enjoy!
